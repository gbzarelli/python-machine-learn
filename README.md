# Python Machine Learn

Studies with machine learn in Python.
In those samples we will use that libaries:
- [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org)

## Projects:

All projects contain a learning sequence, containing what was learned in the previous ones, the lessons will be inserted in that README in order.

### 1 [first_classification](https://github.com/gbzarelli/python-machine-learn/tree/master/first_classification)
 In this project we can see how to implement the Multinomial ([MultinomialNB](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html)) algorithm from the sklearn.naive_bayes library. 

### 2 [categorical_variable](https://github.com/gbzarelli/python-machine-learn/tree/master/categorical_variable)
 The categorical variables are variables that we can not classify only with binary values, that is, 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. One of the examples we used was the search variable that contained the values: algorithms, Java and Ruby. Note that if a variable can have more than one possible value, we consider it as a categorical variable.

## Installing the scikit-learn:
    
    $pip install -U scikit-learn
